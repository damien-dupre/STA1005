## 🛠️ Your Turn! {background="#43464B"}

If you haven't done it already, can you look for the **quantitative academic journal paper which is the closest to your Ph.D**. 

You need to download the pdf version of this paper and to send it to my email damien.dupre@dcu.ie . 

**Warning**:

- This paper should not be one of yours if you already have published some
- This paper should include a statistical analysis (i.e., Regression analysis, ANOVA, $t$-test) and if possible the corresponding $p$-values

# 2. Statistics and Research Papers

## Anatomy of a Paper

The shape of the contents of the research paper resembles an hourglass:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](https://explorable.com/sites/default/files/images/steps-of-the-scientific-method.jpg){fig-align="center"}

**Starts wide** (introduction),**then narrows** (hypotheses, method and results) and **finally opens** (discussion and conclusion).
:::

## A Closer Look at Papers

1. **Introduction** outlines the research question and identifies the variables under investigation.
2. **Literature Review** explains how these variables are connected, presents the theoretical model, and ends with the hypotheses to be tested. 
3. **Methods** details the variables and the mathematical equation that represents the model and includes the tests for all hypotheses.
4. **Results** report the numerical outcomes of the hypothesis tests.
5. **Discussion** and **Conclusion** interpret these findings and highlight the study’s strengths and limitations.

## Essential Concepts to Master

In research outputs, all sections are linked:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Introduction] --> B[Literature<br>Review]
  B --> C[Methods]
  C --> D[Results]
  D --> E[Discussion &<br>Conclusion]
```

. . .

To understand the statistics in the results section it is essential to identify the concepts presented in each section:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Introduction] -- Variables --> B[Literature<br>Review]
  B -- Hypotheses --> C[Methods]
  C -- Model &<br>Equation --> D[Results]
  D -- Statistical<br>Test--> E[Discussion &<br>Conclusion]
```

Thus, it is essential to master the concepts of **Variable**, **Hypothesis**, **Model**, and **Equation** before the actual **Statistical Test**.

# 3. The Introduction: Variables and how to find them?

## Academic Papers' Introduction

An introduction is a section **presenting your variables and why you investigate them**.

There is little reference to previous academic research, just a description of actual facts.

::: {.callout-tip}
## How to start an introduction?

- Method 1: **Number** (e.g., In 2022, the average gender pay gap in Ireland was 9.6%.)
- Method 2: **Event** (e.g., In 2024, the Disney company agreed to settle a class-action after female employees in California accused it of systematically paying women less than men in comparable roles.)
- Method 3: **Quote** (e.g., "The existence of a gender pay gap [...] points to enduring inequality in the valuation of work." (Goldin, 1990))
:::

## Academic Papers' Introduction

It should end with your **Research Question**, a question that includes all the main variables investigated which wonders about a potential relationship between them.

For example:

- *"What is the relationship between Job Satisfaction, Salary and Gender?"*
- *"How does sales experience influence the performance of sales managers and sales representatives?"*

## What is a Variable?

A variable itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning *numbers or characters* to **labels**.

For example:

- My **height** is *183 cm*
- This morning, I had a *large* **coffee**
- My **gender** is *male*

The **bold part is "the thing that varies"** and the *italicised part is "the value of the variable"*.

> Let's collect more data about our classmates on these three variables: height, coffee and gender!

 **Warning**:

- The variable **variability** corresponds to how numbers or characters according each observation.
- Each variable has a **Role** and a **Type**, it is essential to learn how to identify them.

# Type of Variables {background="#43464B"}

## Type of Variables

Variables can have different types:

- **Categorical**: If the variable's possibilities are words or sentences (character string)

  - if the possibilities cannot be ordered: Categorical Nominal (*e.g.*, $gender$ male, female, other)
  
  - if the possibilities can be ordered: Categorical Ordinal (*e.g.*, $size$ S, M, L)
  
- **Continuous**: If the variable's possibilities are numbers (*e.g.*, $age$, $temperature$, ...) 

## Type of Variables

Jamovi, our first statistical software, illustrates them with recognisable icons:

::: {.center}
`r include_img("jamovi_icons.png")`
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Warning

Variables can be converted to either Categorical and Continuous but it is always better to keep them in their correct scale.
:::

# Role of Variables {background="#43464B"}

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

It's important to keep the two roles **"variable doing the explaining"** and **"variable being explained"** distinct.

Let's denote the:

- **Outcome** is the "variable to be explained" (also called $Y$, Dependent Variable, or DV)
- **Predictor** is the "variable doing the explaining" (also called $X$, Independent Variable, or IV)

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

Statistics is only about identifying relationship between Predictor and Outcome variables also called **effect**:

> An effect between 2 variables means that the changes in the values of a predictor variable are related to changes in the values of an outcome variable.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Control Variables

Variables not included in the model OR in the hypotheses but they are in the equation. They are used to remove an irrelevant explanation of the variable changes.
:::

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

The objective is to find the best predictor variable(s) to predict the variability of the Outcome!

One predictor is simple to handle, but using more than one requires more understanding!

::: {.callout-note}
## Outcome's variability is a birthday cake

- If 1 guest eats all the cake: 1 predictor explains all the outcome.
- If 1 guest eats a slice of the cake: 1 predictor explains only part of the outcome.
- If more than 1 guests, they will all eat a slice of different size: each predictor will explain their own part of the outcome
:::

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

An effect between a predictor variable and an outcome variable corresponds to the following model:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 2

digraph {
  rankdir="LR"
  node [shape=box]
  Predictor -> Outcome
}
```

This arrow does not suggest causation but indicate correlation between $Predictor$ and $Outcome$, there is no assumption of one causing the other. **An "effect" is reciprocal and does not involves causality**.

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

::: {.callout-important}
## Warning

Causality analysis is an other kind of test that involves:

- To be sure that 2 variables are correlated
- That one variable is the antecedent of the other
- That no other variable is explaining this relationship
:::

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

A significant effect of a $Predictor$ on an $Outcome$ variable means that **a predictor is explaining enough variance of the outcome** variable.

This shows a significant relationship.

::: {.callout-note}
## Outcome's variability is a birthday cake

A significant effect means the slice eat by the predictor is large enough.
:::

## Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
If there is **no effect** between the variables, they are not sharing enough of their variability

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4

VennDiagram::draw.pairwise.venn(
  100, 100, 10, c("Predictor", "Outcome"), ind = FALSE, cex = 5, cat.cex	= 2, cat.pos = c(0,0)) |> 
  grid::grid.draw()
```
:::

::: {#second-column}
If there is a **significant effect** between the variables, they are sharing a big part of their variability

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4

VennDiagram::draw.pairwise.venn(
  100, 100, 40, c("Predictor", "Outcome"), ind = FALSE, cex = 5, cat.cex	= 2, cat.pos = c(0,0)) |> 
  grid::grid.draw()
```
:::
::::

To decide if the part of the shared variability is big enough, a statistical test is required.

## 🛠️ Your Turn! {background="#43464B"}

In the research paper you have selected, **identify the variables that are used to produce statistical results (e.g. $p$-values).**

Indicate their Type and Role by using the following table:

|variable_name|variable_type|variable_role|
|-|-|-|
|var 1        |type         |role         |
|...          |...          |...          |
|var n        |type         |role         |

Send me the table by email at damien.dupre@dcu.ie **before the next lecture.**

# 4. Literature Review: Formulate your Hypotheses

## Hypotheses in a Nutshell

Hypotheses are:

1. Predictions supported by theory/literature
2. Affirmations designed to precisely describe the relationships between variables

> *“Hypothesis statements contain two or more variables that are measurable or potentially measurable and that specify how the variables are related”* (Kerlinger, 1986)

## Hypotheses in a Nutshell

Hypotheses include:

- Predictor(s) / Independent Variable(s)
- Outcome / Dependent Variable (DV)
- Direction of the outcome if the predictor increases

::: {.callout-important}
## Warning

Hypothesis cannot test equality between groups or modalities, they can only test differences or effects
:::

## Alternative *vs.* Null Hypotheses

- Every hypothesis has to state a change (between groups or according values) also called $H_a$ (for alternative hypothesis) or $H_1$

- Every alternative hypothesis has a null hypothesis counterpart (no difference between groups or according values) also called $H_0$ (pronounce H naught or H zero)

- $H_a$ is viewed as a “challenger” to the null hypothesis $H_0$.

. . .
  
**Statistics are used to estimate the probability of obtaining the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is correct. If this probability is low, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is considered more plausible.**

## Main Effect Hypothesis...

... is the **predicted relationship between one $Predictor$ and one $Outcome$ variable**

- The $Outcome$ needs to be Continuous (but some models can use a Categorical Outcome)

- The $Predictor$ can be either Continuous or Categorical but the hypothesis formulation will change with its type

Effect representation:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 2

digraph {
  rankdir="LR"
  node [shape=box]
  Predictor -> Outcome
}
```

## Main Effect Hypothesis Templates

::: {.callout-note}
## How to use a template?

In the following formulation templates, **replace the variable names with yours** and *select the direction of the effect expected*.
:::

- ### Case 1: Predictor is Continuous 

::: {.center}
The {**outcome**} {*increases/decreases/changes*} when {**predictor**} increases

> **Job satisfaction** *increases* when **salary** increases
:::

## Main Effect Hypothesis Templates

::: {.callout-note}
## How to use a template?

In the following formulation templates, **replace the variable names with yours** and *select the direction of the effect expected*.
:::

- ### Case 2: Predictor is Categorical (2 Categories)

The {**outcome**} of {**predictor category 1**} is {*higher/lower/different*} than the {**outcome**} of {**predictor category 2**}

> The **Job satisfaction** of **EU employees** is *higher* than the **job satisfaction** of **non EU employees**

## Main Effect Hypothesis Templates

::: {.callout-note}
## How to use a template?

In the following formulation templates, **replace the variable names with yours** and *select the direction of the effect expected*.
:::

- ### Case 3: Predictor is Categorical (3 or more Categories)

The {**outcome**} of at least one of the {**predictor**} is {*higher/lower/different*} than the {**outcome**} of the other {**predictor**}

> The **Job satisfaction** of at least one of the **company's departments** is *higher* than the **Job satisfaction** of the other **company's departments**

## Main Effect Hypothesis Examples

- Outcome = Exam Results (continuous from 0 to 100)
- Predictor = Sleep Time (continuous from 0h to 24h)

Effect representation:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 1

digraph {
  rankdir="LR"
  node [shape=box]
  "Sleep Time" -> "Exam Results"
}
```

Main Effect Hypothesis: 

- $H_a$: **Exam results** *increase* when students’ **sleep time** increases

## Main Effect Hypothesis Examples

- Outcome = Exam Results (continuous from 0 to 100)
- Predictor = Breakfast (categorical *yes* or *no*)

Effect representation:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 1

digraph {
  rankdir="LR"
  node [shape=box]
  "Breakfast" -> "Exam Results"
}
```

Main Effect Hypothesis: 

- $H_a$: **Exam results** of students **who eat breakfast** will be *higher* than **exam results** of students **who do not eat breakfast** 

## Main Effect Hypothesis Examples

- Outcome = Driving Errors (continuous from 0 to Inf.)
- Predictor = Talking on the Phone while Driving (categorical *yes*/*no*)

Effect representation:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 1

digraph {
  rankdir="LR"
  node [shape=box]
  "Talking on the Phone while Driving" -> "Driving Errors"
}
```

Main Effect Hypothesis: 

- $H_a$: **Driving errors** of **motorists who do not talk on the phone while driving** will be *lower* than **driving errors** of **motorists who talk on the phone while driving**

## Interaction Effect Hypothesis

**It predicts the influence of a second predictor on the relationship between a first predictor and an outcome variable**

::: {.callout-important}
## Warning

- The second predictor is also called moderator.
- The main effect of each predictor must be hypothesised as well
- The role of first and second predictors can be inverted with the exact same statistical results

## The Hypothesis Checklist

When formulating an hypothesis:

- Is your hypothesis a prediction and not a question?
- Does your hypothesis include both Predictor and Outcome variables?
- Are these variables included in your dataset?

## Note about hypotheses in academic papers

- Don't trust research papers, most of them have incorrect formulations.
- Use the templates shown previously.

## Special Case: Mediation Hypothesis

Remember the birthday cake metaphor: it symbolise the variability of the outcome variable to be explained by the predictors.

Now, imagine one guest take a slice, but the birthday person arrives and take the slice from the guest to eat it.

## Special Case: Mediation Hypothesis

**A mediation is when a Predictor called mediator, explains part of the variability of the outcome already explained by a first predictor.** It is usually used to highlight the influence of psychological features. 

Effect representation:

```{dot}
//| fig-height: 3

digraph {
  graph [rankdir = LR]

  node [shape = box]
  "Predictor 1"; "Predictor 2"; "Outcome"
  
  "Predictor 1" -> {"Predictor 2" "Outcome"}
  "Predictor 2" -> "Outcome"
}
```

## Special Case: Mediation Hypothesis

Formulation structure:

The effect of {**predictor 1**} on {**outcome**} is explained by the {**predictor 2**}

::: {.callout-important}
## Warning

A mediation effect involves 3 requirements:

1. Predictor 1 needs to have a main effect on the Outcome
2. Predictor 1 needs to have a main effect on the Predictor 2
3. The main effect of Predictor 1 on the Outcome needs to disappear when Predictor 2 is taken into account
:::

## Special Case: Mediation Hypothesis

Example: 

- The effect of **employee's age** on **job satisfaction** is explained by their **salary**

Here, the requirements are:

1. Employee's age needs to have a main effect on job satisfaction
2. Employee's age needs to have a main effect on their salary
3. The main effect of Employee's age on the job satisfaction needs to disappear when salary is taken into account

## Mediation Effect Hypothesis Example

- Outcome = Happiness (continuous from 0 to 7)
- Predictor 1 = Exam Results (continuous from 0 to 100)
- Predictor 2 = Self-Esteem (continuous from 0 to 7)

Mediation Effect Hypothesis: 

- $H_a$: The effect of **grades** on **happiness** is explained by **self-esteem**

# 🛠️ Your Turn ! Find the variables in these hypotheses {background="#43464B"}

## Find the variables in these hypotheses {background="#43464B" .smaller}

In the following hypotheses, find the outcome variable and the predictor(s):

1. Overweight adults who value longevity are more likely than other overweight adults to lose their excess weight

2. Larger animals of the same species expend more energy than smaller animals of the same type.

3. Rainbow trout suffer more lice when water levels are low than other trout.

4. Professors who use a student-centred teaching method will have a greater positive rapport with their graduate students than professors who use a teacher-centred teaching method.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

## Solution {background="#43464B" .smaller}

Hypothesis 1:

- Outcome = Excess weight
- Predictor = The valuation of longevity (yes *vs* no)

Hypothesis 2:

- Outcome = Energy expended
- Predictor = Animal size (larger *vs* smaller)

Hypothesis 3:

- Outcome = Suffering lice
- Predictor = Trout type (rainbow *vs* other)

Hypothesis 3:

- Outcome = Rapport with graduate students
- Predictor = Teaching method (student-centreed *vs* teacher-centreed)

| Outcome | Predictor 1 | Predictor 2 | Hypothesis Type |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Work motivation | Gender (Female/Male) |  | Main Effect |
| Work motivation | Gender (Female/Male) | Origin (French/Irish) | Interaction Effect |
| Work motivation | Gender (Female/Male) | Origin (French/Irish/Italian) | Interaction Effect |
| Job satisfaction | Stress (0 to 10) |  | Main Effect |
| Job satisfaction | Stress (0 to 10) | Age (Millennials/Baby Boomers) | Interaction Effect |
| Job satisfaction | Stress (0 to 10) | Age (in years) | Interaction Effect |

```

## Solution {background="#43464B"}

1. The **work motivation** of **female employees** is *higher* than the **work motivation** of **male employees**
2. The effect of **gender** on **work motivation** is *higher* for **Irish employees** than it is for **French employees**
3. The effect of **employee origin** on **work motivation** is *higher* for **female employees** than it is for **male employees**
4. **Job satisfaction** *decreases* when **stress** increases
5. The effect of **stress** on **job satisfaction** is *higher* for **Millennials** than it is for **Baby boomers**
6. The effect of **stress** on **job satisfaction** *increases* when **employee's age** increases
